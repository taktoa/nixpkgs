      The Kythe project was founded to provide and support tools and standards
      that encourage interoperability among programs that manipulate source
      code. At a high level, the main goal of Kythe is to provide a standard,
      language-agnostic interchange mechanism, allowing tools that operate on
      source code including build systems, compilers, interpreters, static
      analyses, editors, code-review applications, and more to share
      information with each other smoothly.
